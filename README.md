# Project Description

Complete [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suites for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

### Steps taken to complete the project

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Write a new test suite named "The menu".
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
6. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
7. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
